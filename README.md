# Touchscreen-Enabled-DS-Code

The code here is what's used for my touchscreen-enabled DS to "consolize" it. I installed a Teensy 4.0 to the DS and replaced the touchscreen driver chip with connections to the Teensy. The code here was used for my personal consolization, using a PS5 controller and a windows laptop. There is a bit of latency with the capture cards, which makes this a suboptimal setup compared to if this setup was installed with an IS-Nitro instead. It's a very difficult hardware installation, and is not easy to replicate.
